# Deforestation Analysis in Colombia - Data Analysis Bootcamp Project

## Project Description
This project was developed as part of a data analysis bootcamp. The main focus was to study deforestation in Colombia over the past 20 years. Through this analysis, the current situation of deforestation in the country was determined, and forecasts based on available historical information were made.

## Tools Used

- **Relational Database:**
  - A database was designed and created using **MySQL Workbench 8.0** to store and manage data related to deforestation in Colombia.

- **Data Analysis:**
  - The data was analyzed using **Python 3.12** along with key libraries such as:
    - `pandas` for data manipulation.
    - `numpy` for numerical calculations.
    - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization.
    - `statsmodels` for ARIMA model implementation.

- **Visualization:**
  - A visual presentation of the data was created using **Power BI**, allowing for interactive exploration and better understanding of the results.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection and Organization:**
   - Historical data on deforestation in Colombia, including statistics on tree cover loss, was collected.
   - The data was organized and stored in the relational database created with MySQL Workbench.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - A detailed analysis was conducted to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in the data.
   - Factors associated with deforestation at the national and regional levels were examined.

3. **Forecasts:**
   - ARIMA models were used to generate two forecast scenarios for deforestation in the near future, based on the available historical data.

4. **Results Visualization:**
   - The analysis results and forecasts were visually presented in Power BI, facilitating interpretation and communication.

## Key Findings
- The main regions and periods with the highest impact of deforestation in Colombia were identified.
- Two forecast scenarios were developed, highlighting possible future deforestation trajectories under different assumptions.
- Interactive visualizations provided a clear understanding of trends and their potential impact.
